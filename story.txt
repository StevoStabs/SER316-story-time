Once upon a time, there was a person who decided to roadtrip across Germany in a BMW. Two days into their journey, they were driving along the Hauptstrasse when their klimaanlage went out. Luckily they were close to a Biergarten, where they sat down and ordered an Apfelkuchen. Unfortunately, they biergarten was out of Apfelkuchen. However, there was a baeckerei across the street! They decided to go there and order a dozen gebaeck, instead. As they approach the baeckerei, a man in a Lederhose bursts through the door screaming as a tiny hund chases after him, barking furiously. The man ran across the square into the Ratskeller. A woman in a dirndel was just leaving the Ratskeller, but the hund caused the woman to trip.
