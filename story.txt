Once upon a time, there was a person who decided to roadtrip across Germany in a BMW. Two days into their journey, they were driving along the Hauptstrasse when their klimaanlage went out. Luckily they were close to a Biergarten, where they sat down and ordered an Apfelkuchen. Unfortunately, they biergarten was out of Apfelkuchen. However, there was a baeckerei across the street! They decided to go there and order a dozen gebaeck, instead.
